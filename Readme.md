I was involved in a project to generate interior design images using line sketches (Lineart) and Prompt. I used ControlNet for training. The first table below shows the generated design images for a residential entrance, a gym and a residential lobby. The second table below provides additional details. As the training steps vary, the generated design images also undergo changes.

    <td>The lighting is ambient indoor lighting, with the main material for walls being wood, and the primary material for the ceiling being latex paint. The theme is modern Oriental, with soft furnishings featuring metal tones and benches. The style is modern Oriental, and the main material for the floor is rubber tiles. The color scheme for the space is cool tones, and the space type is residential, specifically described as the public area of a residence. The main modular materials for the space are metal screens and artistic glass doors, and the image perspective is a one-point perspective.</td>
